# Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Framework

This Framework aims to provide an easy to use toolkit for
Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning research.
Overall architecture:

![processes](./docs/architecture.png)

Environment: There are two differences for Multi-Agent Env Class: 1. The step(action_n) accepts n actions at each time; 2. The Env class needs a MAEnvSpec property which describes the action spaces and observation spaces for all agents.

Agent: the agent class has no difference than common RL agent, it uses the MAEnvSpec from Env Class to init the policy/value nets and replay buffer.

MASampler: Because the agents have to rollout simultaneously, a MASampler Class is designed to perform the sampling steps and add/return the step tuple to each agent's replay buffer.

MATrainer: In single agent, the trainer is included in the Agent Class. However, due to the complexity of Multi-Agent Training, which has to support independent/centralized/communication/opponent modelling, it is necessary to have a MATrainer Class to abstract these requirements from Agent Class. This is the core for Multi-agent training.
